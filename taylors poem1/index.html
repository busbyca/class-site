              <p> these people talk to me and i want to say nothing,
              do nothing,
            i almost want them <br><br>to see as nothing. whatâ€™s the point of just saying things
              because i know it. so <br><br>that others know i know it? what is the fucking
              point?
              to try to do what? Be known <br><br>is known as knowledge also? so that the other
              person knows that i know things too?<br><br> it is so pointless
